  Project Mulla is a MPESA API RESTful mediator. It lets you make familiar HTTP REST requests,
  transforming your requests to the fiddling dreaded SOAP/XML requests that the Safaricom MPESA
  G2 API only understands. It then communicates with the MPESA API gateway, transforming all
  SOAP responses from the MPESA API to RESTful JSON responses that you then can consume effortlessly.
