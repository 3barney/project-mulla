# Installation

Installing {{ site.project_name }} is easy and straight-forward, but there are a few requirements youâ€™ll need
to make sure your system has before you start.

## Requirements

You will need to install some stuff, if they are not yet installed in your machine:

* [Node.js (v4.3.2 or higher; LTS)](http://nodejs.org)
* [NPM (v3.5+; bundled with node.js installation package)](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#updating-npm)

If you've already installed the above you may need to only update **npm** to the latest version:

```bash
$ sudo npm update -g npm
```
